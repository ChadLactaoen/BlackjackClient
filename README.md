# BlackjackClient
Skeleton BlackjackClient to connect to the Blackjack WebSocket server found [here](https://github.com/chadtomas/Blackjack)

## About
First, make sure you've run the Blackjack server as described in its documentation (see above). All the WebSocket configuration is already set up for the client, your job is to write the logic to send messages to the server to complete actions and bets and handle the messages being sent from the server. I've gotten you started by including the piece of code that already registers you to the game.

## Getting Started
Where commented, do NOT edit code that's already provided. If you do a search for "TODO", you should see all the places where your code will go. Feel free to add any methods or classes in addition to the ones already provided, should you need to use it.
